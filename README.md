# TicTacToe3D

This project aims to be a simple console game, where there are tested a few AI algorithms from the easyAI library and trying to implement an Reinforcement Learning algorithm (DQN).

# Dependencies
In order to be able to run the game, you should have installed the following libraries: keras, easyAI, numpy.
> pip install easyai
> pip install keras
> pip install numpy

If you would like to draw the graphs you should also install matplotlib.
> pip3 install matplotlib

If you want to try the reinforcement learning agent, you will also have to install:
> keras
> tensorflow

# How to run

If you want to play, configure `PlayTicTacToe.py` with the desired AI player,  and run it.
